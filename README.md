# RPS-SIS_dynamics
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook where I used the Sympy package to do the math for the stability analysis of a dynamical process I was working on during my PhD (back in 2017-2018). The dynamics is a combination of Rock-Paper-Scissors and SIS-epidemic model. The goal of this repo is not to explain my project but just to give an example of use of symbolic python. 

## Notice:
* Run on python 2.7 kernel.
* The cell "Code" hides the code cells so that the notebook becomes readable as a report.
